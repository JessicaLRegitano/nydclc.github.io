The New York Data Carpentries Library Consortium (NYDCLC) is an association of academic, public, and school librarians who have come together to form a community of practice focused on building data skills, including accessing, analyzing, using, and visualizing data.  NYDCLC allows members to share a Gold-level membership with [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) which affords us a series of workshops on various data skills.

NYDCLC Members receive:  
* Instructional materials and pedagogical training
* A network of data fluent researchers and instructors
* An opportunity to refine skills as instructors at other member institutions
