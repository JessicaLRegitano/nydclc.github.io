The University of Rochester River Campus Libraries, Colgate University, Cornell University, and Syracuse University, have been awarded [a 2019 Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Planning Grant](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/re-11-19-0047-19) to plan and pilot a skill-sharing program, the New York Data Carpentries Learning Consortium. 

As part of our planning, we want to hear from you. [Please complete this survey (10 minutes)](https://colgate.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bjijXlpshWL2TcN), which will help us assess the digital and data skills that are most relevant for our work.

This information will help us provide continuing education and collaboration opportunities for library professionals throughout New York State. Our consortium will use the [Library Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) train-the-trainer model, and will be offering three training opportunities in Fall 2019. 

Thank you for your help!

Sincerely,

[NYDCLC Steering Committee](http://nydclc.github.io/members)
